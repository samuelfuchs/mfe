# Micro Frontend (MFE) Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Micro Frontend (MFE) Project! This repository houses my journey in learning and mastering micro frontend architecture. The primary goal of this project is to explore and understand the nuances of setting up scalable micro frontend services. Through this endeavor, I aim to evolve as a software engineer, gaining a deeper understanding of modern web development practices.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have utilized Webpack to orchestrate the modular construction of the application, focusing on scalability and efficient resource loading. The project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with different technologies and techniques pivotal in the micro frontend landscape.

### Key Features

- **AWS Integration**: 
  - **S3 Bucket**: Creation and configuration of AWS S3 buckets for efficient asset storage and management.
  - **CloudFront**: Setup and integration of AWS CloudFront for content delivery optimization.
  - **IAM User**: Configuration of IAM users for secure and controlled access to AWS services.

- **CSS Scoping Techniques**: Implementation of advanced CSS scoping methods to maintain style integrity across different micro frontends.

- **Framework Diversity**: This application is a melting pot of different frameworks, showcasing how they can coexist in a micro frontend architecture. It includes:
  - **React**: Leveraging React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
  - **Angular**: Utilizing Angular for its comprehensive framework capabilities in larger parts of the application.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained invaluable insights into:

- The intricacies of setting up and managing micro frontend architectures.
- Deep dives into AWS services, understanding their role and integration in web applications.
- The challenges and solutions in maintaining style and functionality isolation in a micro frontend setup.
- Practical implementation of multiple frameworks in a single cohesive application.

## Future Scope

As I continue to evolve this project, I plan to integrate more features and technologies, continuously pushing the boundaries of my understanding and skills in micro frontend architecture.
